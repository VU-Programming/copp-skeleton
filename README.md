# Compiling
Requires make and Clang

Run `make ijvm` to build the ijvm binary

# Running a binary
Run an IJVM program using `./ijvm binary`. For example `./ijvm files/advanced/Tanenbaum.ijvm`.

## Adding header files
Add your header files to the folder `include`.

# Testing
To run a specific test run `make run_testX` (e.g. `make run_test1`).

* To run all basic tests, do `make testbasic`.
* To run all advanced tests, do `make testadvanced`.
* Check for memory leaks using `make testleaks`
* Check for memory errors/ undefined behavior `make testsanitizers` 
* To compile with pedantic flags: `make pedantic`

You can debug the tests by running running the binaries generated by
`make build_tests` through GDB.

# Handing in
Generate a zip of your project using the `make zip` command.
Make sure to double check that all your required files are included in the tarball.

# Tools
You can install the goJASM assembler by executing `make tools`. This will
download a goJASM executable in the tools directory.
